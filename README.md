## SDLC

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process framework used in the development of information systems and software. It describes the stages involved in the creation and maintenance of applications and systems. Below, I briefly outline each phase of the SDLC:

### 1.Planning and Requirement Analysis: 
Planning is a crucial step in everything, just as in software development. In this same stage, requirement analysis is also performed by the developers of the organization. This is attained from customer inputs, and sales department/market surveys.The information from this analysis forms the building blocks of a basic project. The quality of the project is a result of planning. Thus, in this stage, the basic project is designed with all the available information.

### 2.Defining Requirements: 
In this stage, all the requirements for the target software are specified. These requirements get approval from customers, market analysts, and stakeholders. 
This is fulfilled by utilizing SRS (Software Requirement Specification). This is a sort of document that specifies all those things that need to be defined and created during the entire project cycle.

### 3.Designing Architecture: 
SRS is a reference for software designers to come up with the best architecture for the software. Hence, with the requirements defined in SRS, multiple designs for the product architecture are present in the Design Document Specification (DDS). 
This DDS is assessed by market analysts and stakeholders. After evaluating all the possible factors, the most practical and logical design is chosen for development.

### 4.Developing Product:
At this stage, the fundamental development of the product starts. For this, developers use a specific programming code as per the design in the DDS. Hence, it is important for the coders to follow the protocols set by the association. Conventional programming tools like compilers, interpreters, debuggers, etc. are also put into use at this stage. Some popular languages like C/C++, Python, Java, etc. are put into use as per the software regulations. 

### 5.Product Testing and Integration:
After the development of the product, testing of the software is necessary to ensure its smooth execution. Although, minimal testing is conducted at every stage of SDLC. Therefore, at this stage, all the probable flaws are tracked, fixed, and retested. This ensures that the product confronts the quality requirements of SRS. 

### 6.Deployment and Maintenance of Products:
After detailed testing, the conclusive product is released in phases as per the organization’s strategy. Then it is tested in a real industrial environment. It is important to ensure its smooth performance. If it performs well, the organization sends out the product as a whole. After retrieving beneficial feedback, the company releases it as it is or with auxiliary improvements to make it further helpful for the customers. However, this alone is not enough. Therefore, along with the deployment, the product’s supervision.


## LAMP STACK
The LAMP stack is a set of open-source software technologies used together to host websites and web applications. The acronym LAMP refers to the components that make up this stack:

### Linux: 
the operating system on which all other components run. Linux is chosen for its stability, security, and robustness in server environments.

### Apache:
the web server used to serve web pages. Apache is popular for its performance and flexibility in configuration. It handles client requests and delivers the appropriate web content.

### Mysql:
the database management system used to store and manage application data, such as user data, page content, and more. Known for its speed and ease of use.

### PHP:
the programming language (although Python or Perl can also be used). PHP is widely used to develop server-side scripts that process the business logic of the application.

## Cloud Implementation:
In a cloud environment like AWS, deploying a LAMP Stack can be relatively straightforward using services such as Amazon EC2 for computing, Amazon RDS for managing MySQL databases, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk for application management, providing scalability and efficient infrastructure management.

## Managing file permissions and ownership:

### chmod command:
The chmod (change mode) command is used to change the access permissions of files and directories.

### chown command:
The chown (change owner) command is used to change the ownership of a file or directory.

## TCP and UDP:
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are commonly used protocols in the transport layer of the OSI model, with key differences in how they handle communication:

### TCP: 
is connection-oriented and ensures that all packets arrive intact and in the correct order.

### UDP: 
is connectionless, does not guarantee packet delivery, and is ideal for applications that require speed and efficiency in data transmission.

## Common Web Ports:
### HTTP: 
Port 80

### HTTPS:
Port 443

### SSH:
Port 22

### FTP:
Ports 20 and 21

### SFTP:
Port 22
